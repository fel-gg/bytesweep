# Version history

## Reduce Memory 4.0 - final implementation audit

- Added Linux hardware provenance, read-only scope matrix capture, and a real
  10-class x 5-repeat mapping grid invoking the native helper on Ubuntu
  22.04/24.04.
- Kept baseline/fallback as the release strategy where a valid candidate
  comparison is not available; unsupported lab dimensions remain explicit.

## Reduce Memory 4.0 — release candidate

- Contract modules, Windows native session seam, Linux page-out/cgroup
  accounting, bounded cancellation, identity/scope guards, and benchmark
  provenance are included in the source tree.
- Windows x86/x64 build, self-test, working-set trim, refault recovery, and
  Aggressive engine gates pass in CI; Linux Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 native,
  launcher, mode, and installer gates also pass.
- Release status remains evidence-first: no unmeasured reclaim improvement is
  claimed, and any benchmark/scope matrix not present in the final manifest is
  marked pending rather than inferred.

## Reduce Memory 3.0 — hardening update

- Linux native RSS identity now includes process starttime through the final
  session ledger, and reclaim writes are constrained to validated cgroup
  `memory.reclaim` files.
- Linux cache-drop failure is reported per stage instead of aborting independent
  native/cgroup reclaim work.
- Windows foreground protection and x86 threshold bounds are explicit in the
  native protocol path.
- Effectiveness history rejects oversized/corrupt/future data and expires churn
  after 30 days; Temp cleanup adds a final reparse-point check before deletion.
- Native worker waits use short bounded polling slices to reduce UI blocking.
- Elevated parents now use the same owned child-worker/session envelope as
  non-elevated parents, so long Aggressive passes do not execute directly on
  the GUI thread.
- Linux native reclaim validates INT64 byte bounds and kernel swappiness range
  (`0–200`) before opening the cgroup control file.

## Reduce Memory 3.0 — 2026 (development)

- Replaced optimistic per-pass savings with signed, paired before/after
  measurements on Windows and Linux.
- Added explicit unknown/partial accounting for failed post-action queries,
  process exit, identity changes, and Linux permission changes.
- Added one session baseline for Aggressive/Emergency and deduplicated targets
  across repeated passes.
- Updated the Windows native protocol and Linux launcher report with
  measured/unmeasured counters and truthful reduced/increased/unchanged labels.
- Added deterministic M1 contract tests plus fresh x86/x64 source builds and
  real disposable working-set trim verification.

## Reduce Memory 2.9 — 2026 (development)

- Added a reproducible staged Windows build pipeline for AutoIt frontends and
  native workers in x86 and x64.
- Added source-runtime checks, artifact self-tests, and a machine-readable build
  manifest tying the generated executables to a source commit and SHA-256 hash.
- Added a machine-readable M0 baseline that records the original stored binary
  hashes, compiler/include identity, platform/privilege/memory facts, and the
  disposable benchmark contract without copying private INI content.
- Extracted the real Windows trim fixture from CI YAML and added explicit Linux
  fixture/failure adapters, including a fake sync command, so unit tests cannot
  accidentally combine mocked metadata with real global reclaim operations.
- Build output is explicit and isolated from the active portable configuration.

## Reduce Memory 2.8 — 2026

- Added per-process page-fault snapshots and native skip/failure diagnostics.
  Rebound recovery now requires material working-set regrowth plus real page
  faults, including safe handling when the 32-bit fault counter wraps.
- Expanded the elevated worker result to report recovery faults through the UI,
  log, self-test, and disposable x64/x86 CI gates.
- Added a bounded, path-free per-executable effectiveness history. Two proven
  refault events apply a 30-minute Aggressive cooldown; Emergency remains an
  explicit bypass. Old entries are evicted so future software can still be
  learned without shipping a static application list.
- Added per-target released-byte metrics and propagated native skip/failure
  taxonomy through elevated results, tooltips, logs, and CI.
- Native workers now open the matching main application when launched directly.
  `/launch-test` validates pairing in CI; malformed backend calls remain blocked
  by the explicit `/all` or `/pid` authorization guard.
- Added dependency-free native C process workers for Windows x64 and x86.
  Aggressive/Emergency process passes now use a single native Toolhelp snapshot
  and owned handle lifecycle, with validated structured results and automatic
  fallback to the maintained AutoIt engine.
- Added explicit `/all` authorization inside the native worker; without `/all`
  or one `/pid`, it refuses to trim. CI rebuilds both architectures with the
  checksum-pinned official Zig compiler and exercises only disposable targets.
- Added rebound-aware stabilization to full Aggressive on Windows and Linux.
  After the first reclaim settles for three seconds, the backend measures how
  much Available RAM applications took back and performs at most one recovery
  pass only for a material rebound. This keeps processes alive while avoiding
  an endless trim/refault loop.
- Expanded Windows worker accounting with immediate peak, stable gain,
  observed rebound, and recovery-pass fields. These stay separate from gross
  per-process working-set reduction so repeated release is not reported as
  unique RAM saved.
- Consolidated the Windows hot path around a single owned handle per candidate,
  replacing repeated process opens for path, memory, trim, and measurement.
  Rebound recovery now revisits only previously trimmed processes that regained
  at least 16 MB instead of rescanning and trimming the entire candidate set.
- Added a real refault fixture for both Windows architectures: it re-touches a
  256 MB allocation after the initial trim, requires exactly one recovery pass,
  and verifies the target process remains alive.
- Removed 13 provably unreachable helpers inherited from the reconstructed
  Windows source, consolidated repeated numeric INI validation, and reused the
  candidate filter's working-set measurement during trimming. This reduces
  source size and per-pass process queries without weakening safety checks or
  changing the visible mode contract.
- Replaced magic mode/profile numbers and the active obfuscated UI/optimizer
  entry points with named constants and descriptive functions. Mode labels now
  have one source of truth while retaining the established dropdown order and
  numeric INI compatibility.
- Preserved the original `AdjustTokenPrivileges` call error before handle
  cleanup, hardened worker-result numeric validation, and made a timed-out
  elevated worker stop with its temporary result removed instead of continuing
  an unobserved release pass.
- Separated the real Windows candidate floors: Normal now defaults to 96 MB,
  Smooth to 48 MB, Aggressive to 4 MB, and AI Shield to 64 MB. The compatible
  legacy `MinProcessMB` setting remains the baseline for conservative profiles.
- Kept the current foreground window protected in Aggressive while allowing an
  application that has moved to the background to become eligible immediately;
  recent-activity and CPU shields remain active for Normal, Smooth, and AI
  Shield.
- Added a final empty-working-set and standby-purge sequence after the second
  elevated Aggressive process pass. Full Aggressive now reports up to six
  distinct native successes; Emergency reports up to twelve across two cycles.
- Extended the Administrator worker protocol and bounded log with its measured
  available-RAM change, while keeping this system delta separate from the sum
  of per-process working-set reductions.
- Added a disposable full-Aggressive Windows integration gate. It requires two
  elevated process passes, at least four accepted native stages, at least 64 MB
  of measured working-set reduction, and proof that the target stays alive.
- Retained the separately validated Linux Desktop/Server 2.7 reclaim engine in
  the unified 2.8 release; its native syscall, cache, cgroup, and installer gates
  continue to run unchanged.

## Reduce Memory 2.7 — 2026

- Added real per-process Windows working-set measurement before and after every
  successful trim, separate from the system-wide Available RAM delta.
- Replaced the Windows elevated worker's success-only file with a structured
  result containing trim operations, measured bytes, native stages, and pass
  count; both x64 and x86 self-tests validate the parser.
- Made Windows Smooth perform one elevated process pass and made full
  Aggressive bracket its native memory-list/cache release with two elevated
  process passes. Emergency still uses its explicit confirmation and two full
  release cycles.
- Strengthened the Windows integration test with a disposable 256 MB resident
  allocation. A build now fails unless each architecture measurably removes at
  least 64 MB while leaving the process alive.
- Batched up to 64 Linux mappings into each `process_madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT)`
  call, with correct partial-result accounting and scalar compatibility
  fallback. HugeTLB mappings are now excluded explicitly.
- Made Linux Aggressive run native application page-out both before and after
  cache/cgroup reclaim, with counters accumulated across both passes.
- Added cgroup v2 `swappiness=max` anonymous-memory reclaim when swap is
  available, plus plain-request fallback for older kernels.
- Expanded Ubuntu verification for real batch calls, two-pass Aggressive,
  anonymous reclaim syntax, compatibility syntax, and reported totals.

## Reduce Memory 2.6 — 2026

- Separated AI Shield from every general optimization profile. Normal, Smooth,
  Aggressive, Temp, and Emergency no longer inherit AI-name or GPU protection.
- Added distinct Windows trim profiles instead of sending nearly every mode
  through the same process filter.
- Added a documented `SetProcessWorkingSetSizeEx` fallback when the primary
  Windows `EmptyWorkingSet` call cannot trim an otherwise accessible process.
- Made Windows Aggressive perform a broad elevated user/background pass before
  the memory-list and system-file-cache release; foreground/recent applications
  and Windows system processes remain protected.
- Made Emergency confirm before any change, then use its dedicated process
  profile and two complete elevated release passes without killing processes.
- Reworked Linux Normal, Smooth, and Aggressive as separate native profiles:
  conservative large-idle page-out, conservative page-out plus light cache
  release, and all-non-system-user page-out plus cache/cgroup reclaim.
- Increased the default Linux Aggressive cgroup request from roughly 1/16 to
  1/8 of physical RAM, bounded from 512 MB through 4 GB, while still accepting
  a smaller kernel result as valid.
- Preferred the cgroup v2 user slice before root-cgroup fallback and made the
  Server build scan regular plus non-root service UIDs for every native profile
  while keeping root and core daemon names protected.
- Added CI assertions proving AI/GPU flags appear only in AI Shield and proving
  every Linux profile receives its own thresholds and target scope.

## Reduce Memory 2.5 — 2026

- Added AI Shield on Windows, Linux Desktop, and Linux Server while keeping all
  existing mode commands compatible.
- Protected known AI processes on Windows and protected Linux AI command lines,
  GPU-device owners, and their complete child-process trees.
- Kept AI Shield away from global standby/cache purge so active models are less
  likely to reload or stutter.
- Fixed Linux automatic protection accidentally including PID 1, which could
  cause almost every server process to be skipped.
- Made Linux Server AI Shield scan all non-system UIDs while keeping root and
  system services outside the reclaim candidate set.
- Centralized repeated Linux per-pass state initialization and expanded CI for
  AI-pattern protection, mode compatibility, and Desktop/Server menus.

## Reduce Memory 2.4 — 2026

- Added Windows login cleanup through the existing startup option: wait for the
  desktop to settle, run one silent Normal pass, and keep only a hidden monitor.
- Added a 95% RAM pressure trigger requiring two consecutive samples.
- Added a five-minute cooldown and 90% re-arm watermark so sustained pressure
  cannot create a trim/reload loop.
- Kept startup non-elevated and independent from the manual dropdown, so an
  Emergency/Aggressive selection never creates a login UAC prompt or stutter.
- Added a named per-user mutex so duplicate startup shortcuts cannot create
  duplicate monitors, while retaining `/H` compatibility for old shortcuts.
- Added deterministic monitor-policy self-tests on Windows x64 and x86.

## Reduce Memory 2.3 — 2026

- Rebuilt Linux Aggressive around `pidfd_open` and
  `process_madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT)` so it can reclaim resident mappings from idle
  applications instead of depending only on cache and cgroup layout.
- Added dynamic `/proc` discovery for current and future applications without a
  process-name allowlist.
- Added CPU-activity, foreground, descendant, ancestor, minimum-RSS, locked-page,
  device-mapping, and kernel-mapping shields.
- Added per-pass process, mapping, bytes-advised, and measured RSS-reduction
  reporting.
- Bundled the native syscall helper in both Linux Desktop and Server installers
  and release packages.
- Added a real Ubuntu page-out integration test against a disposable 128 MB
  resident mapping while proving the target process remains alive.

## Reduce Memory 2.2 — 2026

- Promoted the maintained Windows, Linux Desktop, and Linux Server builds to
  one consistent 2.2 version identity.
- Includes the verified AutoIt 3.3.6.1 compatibility fix for Optimize.
- Includes expanded Windows candidate-selection self-tests on x64 and x86.
- Includes the Linux application launcher and headless Server/VPS installer.
- Includes cross-platform GitHub Actions checks for Windows, Ubuntu desktop
  installation, and Ubuntu server installation.
- Adds automated, tag-driven GitHub Release packages and SHA-256 checksums.
- Separates the Desktop launcher and headless Server installer into distinct
  source and package paths without duplicating the Linux memory engine.
- Reworks Aggressive on Linux around native cgroup v2 `memory.reclaim` instead
  of treating `compact_memory` as RAM release.
- Adds separate Linux measurements for available memory, file cache, anonymous
  application memory, and swap so small results are explained truthfully.
- Adds executable Ubuntu integration coverage for the root-only Smooth and
  Aggressive paths against disposable kernel-interface fixtures.

## Reduce Memory 2.0 — 2026

This project is inspired by Reduce Memory v1.7 from Sordum Team and continues
that idea with an upgraded source and new platform builds.

- Added five selectable optimization modes, including manual Emergency Release.
- Added Aggressive Smooth for a stronger release with less stutter risk.
- Added Aggressive Release memory-list operations.
- Added optional permanent Temp cleanup with locked-file skipping.
- Added Windows x64 and x86 builds.
- Added a native Linux companion script.
- Added a simple Linux menu plus user-local application launcher, with root
  requested only after Smooth or Aggressive is selected.
- Added a headless Linux Server/VPS installer and `reduce-memory-server` SSH
  command without adding a daemon or automatic trigger.
- Fixed the optimizer dropdown so its items and default selection remain visible.
- Removed the post-Optimize result popup and kept status in the main window.
- Added foreground, recently-active, and CPU-activity shields without maintaining
  a list of application names.
- Added immediate and stable-after-15-seconds results, rebound guard, and a
  bounded local operation log.
- Added worker result verification so cancelled or failed privileged operations
  are no longer reported as successful.
- Added safe built-in self-tests and Windows/Linux GitHub Actions verification.
- Fixed an Optimize crash caused by the unsupported AutoIt 3.3.6.1
  `ProcessGetPath()` function and replaced it with a compatible Windows API.
- Expanded self-test coverage to execute the complete Normal candidate-selection
  path on both x64 and x86 before a build is accepted.

## Earlier foundation

The original Reduce Memory v1.7 workflow remains the historical foundation for
this project. Original local backups are kept outside Git so the repository
contains only the maintained source, builds, and documentation.
